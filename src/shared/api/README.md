# ðŸ“‚ API Directory

This folder is dedicated to configuring and managing all API integrations for the project, whether using REST or GraphQL. The structure and files inside this directory help organize the setup and ensure a clean separation of concerns.

## Purpose

- Centralize the configuration for REST and GraphQL APIs.
- Define endpoints, queries, mutations, and client settings.
- Provide reusable types and utilities to streamline API interaction.

## Suggested Structure
